# MSE-LED-Kuschelbox

Nightly Build

A SK6812 RGBW strip mounted in the MSE Kuschelbox connected to an ESP32.  
Acts like a normal white light upon powerup (about 500ms delay), but is actually a controllable LED strip over MQTT and Art-Net.

The strip draws a bit above 3A @ 5V on the default color (mixed white + RGB).
